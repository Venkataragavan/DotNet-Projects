This page is designed by a bunch of curious trainees, eager to make a difference with their work.  Health is always a major concern for every human being,
 but with time and stress in our everyday life, the concern has since reduced. This concern is always looked upon as a burden which often leads to lethargy.

The task we took up is to just ease the work for a patient by allowing him to search clinics or doctors as per his/her location or as related to the 
health problem. Not only is the search of a doctor is possible with the click of a button, but also the booking of appointments.
